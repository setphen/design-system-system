Welcome to Design System System. This is a minimal, boilerplate project built
with [Hugo] intended as a tool for documenting design systems and component
libraries.

This example project serves to explain how content is organized, and some other
finer details. If you're looking for a quick-and-dirty starting guide, check out
the project's [README].
