  Typography is a key element of visual design.

Typography is a cornerstone of visual design. This is where you can document
how to use typography effectively in your designs. By default, Design System
System uses system fonts, which means no fonts are included (or downloaded from
a CDN) in the project. You can extend the styles to include your own fonts here.

```
body {
  font-family: -apple-system,system-ui,BlinkMacSystemFont,"Segoe UI",Roboto,"Helvetica Neue",Arial,sans-serif;
}
```

Consider adding information here about your font license, too.
