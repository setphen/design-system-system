  Conventions for keeping our code clean and consistent

---

This is a good place to describe practices for contributing code that is clean
and consistent with the rest of the codebase.

Does your team follow a naming convention for writing CSS? Do you follow an
established standard, like [B.E.M.]?  Make it known here! You can use backticks
to include example, like this: `` ``` code ``` ``

```
.a-class-name {
  user-select: none;
}
```
